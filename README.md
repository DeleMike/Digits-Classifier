# Digits-Classifier
This repository contains a notebook used for building a deep neural network for classifying hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. 

It shows how to use FNN that achieved an average accuracy of `97%-98%` and also used Dropout and hyper-parameter tuning to reduce over-fitting. 

**Observations/Lessons Learnt**
- I need a validation dataset. I used the test set for validation and testing.
- I need to learn more data pre-processing techniques.
